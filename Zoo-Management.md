## Assignment

Animals:

- Horses (horse, zebra, donkey etc.),
- Felines (tiger, lion etc.),
- Rodents (rat, beaver etc.)


- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
- species name, weight, age, etc.
- The system should also be able to take the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage ()
- The system should be able to calculate the feeding times => getFeedSchedule ()
- The logic for the system to perform these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses and different for tigers.
