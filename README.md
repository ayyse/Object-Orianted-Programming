## Assignment2 Zoo Management UML Diagram

Animals:

- Horses (horse, zebra, donkey etc.),
- Felines (tiger, lion etc.),
- Rodents (rat, beaver etc.)


- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
- species name, weight, age, etc.
- The system should also be able to take the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage ()
- The system should be able to calculate the feeding times => getFeedSchedule ()
- The logic for the system to perform these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses and different for tigers.


**Using the polymorphism model, design a class diagram to handle the situation described above.**
