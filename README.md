## Assignment1 University Management System UML Diagram
- There are classrooms, study offices and departments belonging to the university.
- There are offices belonging to the departments.
- There are university employees. These employees can be professors or officers.
- Every employee works in an office.

**Draw the Class diagram describing this system.**

*Note: It is not necessary to specify the attributes and behaviors of the classes.*

## Assignment2 Zoo Management UML Diagram

Animals:

- Horses (horse, zebra, donkey etc.),
- Felines (tiger, lion etc.),
- Rodents (rat, beaver etc.)


- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
- species name, weight, age, etc.
- The system should also be able to take the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage ()
- The system should be able to calculate the feeding times => getFeedSchedule ()
- The logic for the system to perform these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses and different for tigers.


**Using the polymorphism model, design a class diagram to handle the situation described above.**
